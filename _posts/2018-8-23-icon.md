---

[Glyphicons](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/components/) from Bootstrap has very useful and popular, when you need some simple icon. However, in Bootstrap 4, the Glyphicons has been removed. However, it does suggestion several alternatives to achieve the same purpose:

  - the upstream version of [Glyphicons](https://glyphicons.com/), which is **NOT free** to use;
  - [Octicons](https://octicons.github.com/), which is free to use;
  - [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/), which is free to use;
  - [open-iconic](https://github.com/iconic/open-iconic), which is also free to use;
  - [feature](https://github.com/colebemis/feather), which is also free to use. One of the best thing is that it provides native support of react [react-feather](https://github.com/carmelopullara/react-feather).
  
Some other icons worth of mentioning:

  - [Super Tiny Social Icons](https://github.com/edent/SuperTinySocialIcons), which contains miniscule SVG versions of your favourite logos;
