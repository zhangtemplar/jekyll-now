title: MacPorts for Mac

> The MacPorts Project is an open-source community initiative to design an easy-to-use system for compiling, installing, and upgrading either command-line, X11 or Aqua based open-source software on the [Mac operating system](http://www.apple.com/macos/).

# MacPorts vs HomeBrew

Both MacPorts and HomeBrew help you install command line and library to Mac OS. There are some differences:

- MacPorts almost always builds packages from source, while Homebrew has continuously gotten less and less permissive of letting you do this (opting instead for downloading pre-built binaries)
- MacPorts has more package than HomeBrew. https://www.slant.co/versus/1588/1674/~macports_vs_homebrew
- MacPorts requires sudo permission to install package while HomeBrew could install without sudo. However, you may frequently faces link or path cannot find issue after OS update for HomeBrew

So I choose MacPorts now

# Install MacPorts

> I don't have environment to test it for M1 chip based Mac

Follow the instructions on the [website](https://www.macports.org/install.php):

- Install [Xcode and the Xcode Command Line Tools](https://guide.macports.org/#installing.xcode)
- Agree to Xcode license in Terminal: `sudo xcodebuild -license`

## Possible Installation Errors

### Error in Installing `gd2` 

`gd2` is a depdendency to many packages. You may run into the following errors:

```
Error: Failed to configure gd2, consult /opt/local/var/macports/build/_opt_local_var_macports_sources_rsync.macports.org_macports_release_tarballs_ports_graphics_gd2/gd2/work/libgd-2.3.0/config.log
Error: Failed to configure gd2: configure failure: command execution failed
```

To fix this, please follow [this instrucitons](https://trac.macports.org/ticket/61541)

```bash

### xcode-select: error: command line tools are already installed, use "Software Update" to install updates

This is more like a warning, if it causes other errors, please check the solutions above.
