title: Pandas Tips

Recently I got a task of checking whether the excel has some some wrong data. There are some conditions where some columns must meet. Using the `Excel` filtering or equation is cumbersome, as the condition can be very complex.

I always try to use Python for this type task, espeicially `Pandas` provides very good support of excel.

To open an excel, we can use the following code:
```
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_excel("input.xlsx")
```

To filter out the data which doesn't meet the conditions, we can use the following code:
```
df[
    (
        (
            (~df['Item Type'].isin([u"ACCESSORY", u"MEMORY", u"SOFTWARE", u"TBD"]))
            & (df["Item Family"] != df["Item Type"]))
        & (~df["Item Root"].str.match(u"SERVER STORAGE", False, na=False))
    )
    | (
        (
            (~df['Item Type'].isin([u"ACCESSORY", u"MEMORY", u"SOFTWARE", u"TBD", u"WARRANTY", u"CABLE", u"OPTIC"]))
            & (df["Item Family"] != df["Item Type"])
        )
        & (df["Item Root"].str.match(u"SERVER STORAGE", False, na=False))
    )
    ].to_excel("output.xlsx")
```

You can replace `to_excel` to `count()` to find the number of filtered result; `head` to find some example of the filter result.

However, there are some special notes about the filtering/condition in `Pandas`:

  - for `str.match(word, check_case, na)`, be aware of `na` which deals the return value in case data is not available (na);
  - for `&` (and) or `|` (or), `Pandas` seems to have bad time in handling more than two conditions by `&` or `|`, thus we'd better bracket for every two conditions;
  - for not, please use `~`. Also bracket around the not-condition;
