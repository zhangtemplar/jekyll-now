You should refer to [Getting Started With Jetson Nano Developer Kit](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/learn/get-started-jetson-nano-devkit) to set up your Jetson Nano from hardware side and then [TensorFlow For Jetson Platform](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/dgx/install-tf-xavier/index.html) for installing the Tensorflow.

The step is intuitive:
```
sudo apt-get install libhdf5-serial-dev hdf5-tools
sudo apt-get install python3-pip
pip3 install -U pip
sudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev zip libjpeg8-dev libhdf5-dev 
sudo pip3 install -U numpy grpcio absl-py py-cpuinfo psutil portpicker grpcio six mock requests gast h5py astor termcolor
```

However, please note there is a bug for `pip@19.1` (for more information, please read [After pip 10 upgrade on pyenv "ImportError: cannot import name 'main'"](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/5240)):
```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/bin/pip3", line 9, in <module>
    from pip import main
ImportError: cannot import name 'main'
```

To fix it, there are several possbilties:
- modifiy the pip file: `from pip._internal import main`
- try to install a version without this bug: `pip install --upgrade pip==9.0.3`
