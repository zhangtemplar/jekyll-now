title: Compute Discounted Cash Flow for Buying a House as Investment
tags: finance dcf house 
---
In this post, I apply DCF to evaluate whether it is a good idea to buy a house as investment. Here I use the numbers for a typical townhouse in bay area. Based on my analysis here, it may not be a good investment to buy a house for rent in Bay area--it could take more than 30 years to pay back your investment from rent.

[Discounted Cash Flow](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dcf.asp) or DCF is a valuation method used to estimate the value of an investment based on its expected future cash flows. DCF analysis attempts to figure out the value of an investment today, based on projections of how much money it will generate in the future. Please check previous post [How to Evaluate a Company for Investment](https://zhangtemplar.github.io/how-to-evaluate-company/) for more details.

Those are the assumptions I made for this analysis:

```python
# mortgage
# tax benefit is not considered
monthly_mortgage_payment = 2500
anual_mortagate_interest_rate = 0.025
term_of_mortgage_year = 30

# other cost on house
anual_property_tax_rate = 0.0125
# in some cases, hoa could increase as well
monthly_hoa_fee = 300
monthly_house_insurance = 100
# the fee to sell the house
house_sell_cost_ratio = 0.06

# affect house price and property tax
anual_house_increase_rate = 0.03

# initial cost of buying house
house_purchase_price = 780000
downpay = 80000

# rent related
# tax is not considered
monthly_rent = 3000
anual_rent_occupied_month = 11
anual_rent_increase_rate = 0.03
years_to_rent = 30

# use 10-year treasury bond as price of your money
anual_interest_rate = 0.04
```

Then the DCF for buying the house can compute as:

```python
def compute_dcf(
    years_to_rent,
    anual_interest_rate,
    monthly_rent,
    anual_rent_occupied_month,
    anual_rent_increase_rate,
    monthly_hoa_fee,
    monthly_house_insurance,
    anual_property_tax_rate,
    house_purchase_price,
    anual_house_increase_rate,
    term_of_mortgage_year,
    monthly_mortgage_payment,
  ):
  result = 0.0
  income = []
  cost = []
  for year in range(years_to_rent):
    factor = (1 / (1 + anual_interest_rate)) ** year
    # rent income
    anual_rent_income = monthly_rent * anual_rent_occupied_month * ((1 + anual_rent_increase_rate) ** year)
    income.append(anual_rent_income)
    # house cost
    anual_house_cost = monthly_hoa_fee * 12 + monthly_house_insurance * 12 + anual_property_tax_rate * house_purchase_price * ((1 + anual_house_increase_rate) ** year)
    # if mortgate is still applicable
    if year < term_of_mortgage_year:
      anual_house_cost += monthly_mortgage_payment * 12
    cost.append(anual_house_cost)
    result += (anual_rent_income - anual_house_cost) * factor
  return result, income, cost

def compute_income_from_selling(
    year,
    downpay,
    house_purchase_price,
    anual_house_increase_rate,
    anual_mortagate_interest_rate,
    term_of_mortgage_year,
    house_sell_cost_ratio,
):
  # if mortgage is paid off
  if year > term_of_mortgage_year:
    return (1 - house_sell_cost_ratio) * house_purchase_price * (1 + anual_house_increase_rate) ** year
  # if there is remaining balance in mortgage
  a = (1 + anual_mortagate_interest_rate) ** year
  b = (1 + anual_mortagate_interest_rate) ** term_of_mortgage_year
  c = (b - a) / ((1 + anual_mortagate_interest_rate) ** (b - 1))
  balance_in_mortgage = (house_purchase_price - downpay) * c
  return (1 - house_sell_cost_ratio) * house_purchase_price * (1 + anual_house_increase_rate) ** year - balance_in_mortgage
```

Use the assumptions I made above, then we could get DCF plot as below. So it takes 36 years to get your investmen back. Here we don't consider the income of selling the house at the end of investment.

If we consider the income of selling the house at the end of investment, then we have the following plot. It shows we could the investment back at 4th year, which makes it very attractive investment.

If you are interested in the anual income and cost, you could also look at following charts. It shows the income and cost breaks even in year 14.
